My name is Ali. I’m a Physics PhD student at the University of Washington, currently based at CERN in Geneva.

My current research focuses on searching for Higgs boson decays to tau leptons at the LHC. I’m also working on applying state of the art machine learning algorithms to solve problems in high energy physics.

Outside of work, I enjoy hiking, cycling, playing soccer, and racket sports. I also write a weekly blog where I share thoughts on various topics and highlight interesting things I’ve recently read.
